Hi! This is my Custom Python Cipher Script.

This is a simple caesar cipher script.

It takes two arguments. The inputted text and the desired character shift.

It checks to see if the text is in the alphabet and iterates through each word capitalizing and shifting the words down.

it then displays the encrypted code in blocks of 5 characters
